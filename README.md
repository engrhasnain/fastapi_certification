# 🎓 FastAPI Developer Certification

This repository highlights my completion of the **FastAPI Development Course** from **Coursera**, where I gained hands-on experience in building, testing, and deploying high-performance APIs using **FastAPI** — one of the fastest modern Python frameworks for backend development.

## 🚀 What I Learned

### ✅ **1. Building RESTful APIs**
- Developed fully functional REST APIs using **FastAPI**.  
- Implemented CRUD operations with asynchronous endpoints for performance optimization.  
- Designed structured and scalable API routes with data validation using **Pydantic** models.

### 🔐 **2. Authentication & Authorization**
- Integrated secure **user authentication** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).  
- Implemented user registration, login, and session management systems.  
- Managed protected routes and user permissions for safe API access.

### 🧩 **3. Database Integration**
- Connected FastAPI applications with **asynchronous databases** (PostgreSQL / SQLite) using ORMs.  
- Designed and managed database schemas efficiently.  
- Practiced proper data modeling and relationships for scalable backends.

### 🧠 **4. Logging, Testing, and Debugging**
- Implemented **comprehensive logging** to monitor system events and errors.  
- Used **pytest** for writing automated tests ensuring robust and reliable APIs.  
- Applied effective debugging techniques to maintain production-quality code.

### ⚙️ **5. Background Tasks**
- Utilized FastAPI’s **background tasks** for asynchronous operations like:
  - Image processing and generation.
  - Sending verification and notification emails.  
- Enhanced performance by offloading long-running processes.

### ☁️ **6. Deployment and CI/CD**
- Deployed FastAPI applications on **Render** and other cloud platforms.  
- Configured **Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines for automated testing and updates.  
- Managed environment variables and application configurations for production readiness.
